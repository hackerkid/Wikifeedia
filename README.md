## How it works?

![alt tag](images/gif.gif)

The home page of Wikifeedia consist of a news feed of Featured articles. Featured articles are considered to be the best articles in Wikipedia. As of now there is no API for getting a list of featured articles that changes each time one make a request. To facilitate this I had to to make a new API server along with some Javascript tweaks.

The backend of Wikifeedia can be found [here](https://github.com/hackerkid/Wikifeedia-backend).

## Installation 
```
git clone https://github.com/hackerkid/Wikifeedia/
cd Wikifeedia
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
Now browse to http://localhost:8000 . 

Equivalent python3 command is `python3 -m http.server`
