##Wikipedia delivered as a Newsfeed

I love Wikipedia. It is the first place I would look at when I want to learn more about some stuff. Like me, most of the people use Wikipedia only when they want to learn more about something. Why is people not visiting Wikipedia for inrceasing their knowladge like Quora?. [Wikifeedia](http://vishnuks.com/Wikifeedia) was made to fix that problem.  

##How it works?

The home page of Wikifeedia consist of a news feed of Featured articles. Featured articles are considered to be the best articles in Wikipedia. As of now there is no API for getting a list of featured articles that changes each time one make a request. To facilitate this I had to to make a new API server along with some Javascript tweaks.

The frontend of Wikifeedia can be found [here](https://github.com/hackerkid/Wikifeedia-backend).
